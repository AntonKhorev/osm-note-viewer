# osm-note-viewer

View an [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) user's [notes](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Notes) in a table with all their comments and on a map. An alternative to `https://www.openstreetmap.org/user/`**`username`**`/notes`. Works purely through [OSM API](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/API_v0.6#Map_Notes_API).

Try it out [here](https://antonkhorev.github.io/osm-note-viewer/).

Other alternatives:

- [My OpenStreetMap Notes](https://my-notes.osm-hr.org/): shows only unresolved notes
- [NotesReview](https://ent8r.github.io/NotesReview/), click *Filter*, enter username in *User*, select *Status* = *All*, set *Limit* to as high as possible: unfortunately the max limit is just 100
